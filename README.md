## To Run Distro Related Process

To run a Distro, type `distrolaunch`, it will ask you what distro are you trying to execute, type `debian` and it will take you there ,

or use `proot-distro instead`

## App not supported on Termux, Run this when on Proot;

```
export DISPLAY=:1
firefox-esr
```

Tada!!
